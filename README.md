# Kick-start-machine-learning
## Begginner code for machine learning's popular algorithms

*  Written each implementation from scratch using several dataset
*  Files include the code plus the data
*  Includes algorithm from different domains -  **regression, classifiation, dimensionality reduction, clustering, ensembles, neural networks, trees, etc**
